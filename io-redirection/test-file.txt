Hello
I am a message.
I am redirected from the file:
TestData
This means that I, although I am a file
I am communicating with you through the standard input
(That means std::cin, that you are using std::getline on)
I magically appear inside your variable named
input.
I can also contain numbers, like: 10009421
You will never see this line
